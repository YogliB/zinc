# Code Style and Conventions

- Prefer functional programming: pure functions, composition over inheritance, immutable data, higher-order functions.
- Avoid classes unless necessary.
- Use closures for encapsulation.
- Return new data structures, don't mutate.
- No comments in code; code must explain itself.
- Clear, intention-revealing names.
- Small, focused functions.
- Simple control flow, early returns.
- Express intent via types and tests (though no tests in MVP).
- Follow Clean Code: clarity > cleverness.
- Naming: functions as verbs, types as nouns, include units/context.
- No inline comments, docstrings, TODO/FIXME.
