# Usage

## Flowbite-Svelte Components

The zinc/ide project now includes the flowbite-svelte library, providing a collection of pre-built UI components based on Tailwind CSS and Flowbite. These components can be imported and used in Svelte pages for consistent styling and functionality.

For example, to use a Button component:

```svelte
<script>
  import { Button } from 'flowbite-svelte';
</script>

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

Refer to the [Flowbite Svelte Documentation](https://flowbite-svelte.com/) for a full list of available components and their usage.
